!1 Report your run using Allure Framework
When running from a CI server we can ask for Allure results by setting ''createAllureResults'' to ''true''
For example, run suite using: ''!-mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test -DfitnesseSuiteToRun=HsacExamples.SlimTests.BrowserTests.AllureReportExample -DcreateAllureResults=true-!''

After this run, we can execute mvn site to now create a dashboard using Allure.

This example suite contains tags, has a passing, failing and broken testcase to demonstrate the visual features.

'''Features:'''

 * The dashboard shows an aggregate of all runs in target/allure-results (so running multiple suites and generating one report is possible - don't clean between runs!)
 * If tags are provided on the test pages, these are visible as functional 'stories' in the report
 * HSAC's fitnesse eport is copied and integrated as an attachment per test case
 * If exceptions were thrown, screenshot and pagesource are attached separately
